# Weather_Analysis_with_Python_and_API_Requets
Analyzing weather patterns closer to the equator using Python and API Requests

The purpose this project is to analyze the weather for 500+ random cities and find nearby hotels in cities with "ideal weather."

## General Info
This code is to analyze the current weather conditions in the randomized cities to evaluate weather patterns by latitude. The second part of this code is to narrow down the cities to those with current conditions that are considered "ideal weather." Ideal Weather is between 70 and 80 degrees (F), with wind speed less than 10 mph, and with zero percent cloudinesss. From that dataset, the code is looking for the nearest hotel within 5000 meters of the city's latitude and longitude. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:  
* Pandas 1.0.5  
* Jupyter Notebook 4.6.3  
* Matplotlib 3.3.2  
* Python 3.6.10
* Citipy 0.0.5
* gmaps 

## Setup
To run the code, open it with jupyter Notebook. Citipy and gmaps will need to be installed. You will need an API key for open weather and google.
